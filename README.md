Tiny Settlement Conquests is an exciting project that brings the beloved world of Catan to life in a new dimension. As a clone of the classic game Catan, we aim to provide a unique gaming experience that captures the charm and challenges of the original while also creating new opportunities for players.

### Disclaimer:
 Please note that the project is still in an early phase of development and some bugs may occour

## Project Overview
Our goal is to develop a complete Catan clone, which will initially be available as a single-player game. The current version already includes some core features, including random map generation, building roads, villages and cities, as well as a basic bot for solo players.

## Current State Overview
- Randomly generated map: Each game starts on an unique map, ensuring a varied player experience.
- Building roads, villages, cities: Players can expand their settlements and territory on the map.
- Basic bot: A simple computer-controlled opponent allows single players to compete against a virtual opponent.
- Event history: A record of past events and moves to make the game progress understandable and support strategic decisions.
- Trade: The ability to trade resources with other players or the bank to develop strategies and overcome resource shortages.

## Missing Features
While our current version already offers some basic features, there are still some key elements missing to complete the player experience:
- Development cards: A variety of cards that grant players various advantages or influence the course of the game.
- Map editor: A tool that allows players to create and share their own maps to create customized game worlds.
- Robber

## Future Outlook
We have big plans for the future of Tiny Settlement Conquests. We plan to introduce a multiplayer version that allows players to test their skills and strategies in real-time against other players around the world.
